  <p>I have been a working artist for over fourteen years and teaching for the last eight.  I work in a variety of mediums but lately have been working in Acrylic Paint. I teach High School Advanced Drawing in Austin, Texas as well as Art 1 and AP Drawing Portfolio.</p>
  <p>I grew up in the Houston area and relocated to Austin Texas in 2000 where I attended UT for Studio Art. Since graduating in 2004, I have put my transmedia skills to work as a cheif editor for a web based television program in Houston, and worked on a number of small local productions.  I began teaching in 2008 and love the people I have met along the way.</p>
  <p>Most recently, I was the featured artist for Blue Moon Inc. at Euphoria Fest.</p>
  <p>Please contact me about collaborating or commisions.</p>
